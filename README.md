# AI Tools Assignment: Named Entity Recognition with spaCy üß†üõ†Ô∏è

## üìå Project Overview

This project demonstrates the use of **spaCy**, a powerful NLP library, to perform **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** on real-world text. The assignment was done individually as part of the "AI Tools and Applications" course.

---

## üíª Technologies Used
- Google Colab (for coding and testing)
- spaCy (`en_core_web_sm` model)
- Python 3

## üß† Task Description

Using spaCy, I analyzed a sample sentence and extracted key entities such as people, places, and organizations. The goal was to explore Natural Language Processing and AI frameworks.

**Sample sentence:**
> *"Elon Musk visited Nairobi to meet the President of Kenya and discuss Tesla's expansion in East Africa."*

**Entities extracted:**
Elon Musk --> PERSON
Nairobi --> GPE
President --> ORG
Kenya --> GPE
Tesla --> ORG
East Africa --> GPE
